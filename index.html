  <h1>4. No Free Hunch</h1>
  <b><h3>Run By: Kaggle<br/>
	  Website link: <a href="Blog.Kaggle.com">Blog.Kaggle.com</a>
	</h3></b>
	<br/><br/>

  <blockquote>
    <p>This blog is slightly different than the others, offering a look directly into the minds of data scientists, as well as tutorials and news. This is the blog of the data science website Kaggle, which hosts data science projects and competitions that challenges data scientists to produce the best models for featured data sets. Organizations can post their data problems with a prize amount and data professionals will enter to solve it. Crowdsourcing ensures that the experiments are innovative and interesting—and offer a lot of perspectives to learn from.

Over 200 competitions have run, including high profile ones like improving Microsoft Kinect gesture recognition, improving the search for the Higgs boson at CERN, and the notorious Heritage Health $3 million award for improving predictions regarding which patients will need to visit hospitals. Kaggle’s official blog goes deeper into these competitions, offering interviews with the winners to discuss their approach to solving the data science problems. The blog also features news and tutorials for all levels of data science enthusiasts.
